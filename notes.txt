Storage
- sqlite3 backend
- Document = Block

Block
- uid = public key id (md5 hash of public key)
- single binary blob
- data can be 65K binary blob

Server
- Only allow get/put if the requester proves key ownership (salt database)
- Handle fragmented put/get requests (65K max size, 1.5K max packet size)

Client
- Unique public key per block is annoying,
  so one master key per client, and auto handled per block keys



1 public key -> several blocks with unique block number -> each block has one bin blob
